#1-Messenger) It's your choice to walk out right now or venture in to the underworld.
But I remind you that no matter what you do, you can't change your fate

#2-Player) If that's the case, why did you bother to guide me here?

#1-Messenger) Hades, too, knows you're bound to fail; but he respects your foolishness.
